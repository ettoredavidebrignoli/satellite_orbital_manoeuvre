# satellite_orbital_manoeuvre

Overview
This project analyzes strategies for transferring satellites between different orbits around Earth. The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

Evaluate Energy Efficiency: Assess the energy consumption required for various transfer maneuvers using impulsive strategies.
Analyze Time Efficiency: Compare the time required for each transfer strategy to determine the most expedient options.
Optimize Transfer Strategies: Identify the best compromise between energy and time for different mission profiles.
