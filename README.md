# Satellite Orbital Transfer Strategies Analysis

## Overview
The project explores different maneuvers required to transfer a satellite from an initial orbit to a final orbit around Earth, characterized by specific Keplerian parameters. The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

- **Evaluate Energy Efficiency**: Assess the energy consumption required for various transfer maneuvers using impulsive strategies.
- **Analyze Time Efficiency**: Compare the time required for each transfer strategy to determine the most expedient options.
- **Optimize Transfer Strategies**: Identify the best compromise between energy and time for different mission profiles.

We found the best strategy using a direct parabolic manoeuvre from the initial point to the final and we optimized the parameter minimizing a cost function.
